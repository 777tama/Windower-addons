Will sell all instances of item found in inventory INSTANTLY. No quotes are needed around item name. You must open 
sales menu once upon zoning. Will not try to sell items equipped, in bazaar or items that can not be sold to NPC vendors.

##### If there has been a mainenance or update to the game make sure windowers resource files have been updated to reflect new items added.

Disclaimer: AuctionHelper, Trade, TradeNPC SellNPC and NPCit inject packet to the ffxi server and have a potential risk of getting you banned. Most of these addons pose nominal risks that everyday windower users are exposed to by addons such as gearswap or autojoin and as such should not get you banned. However some features such as selling all items instantly(NPCit), is something the client cannot do natively and would have a greater chance of actions taken against your account.
